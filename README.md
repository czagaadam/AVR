# AVR

Welcome to AVR wiki!

The purpose of this repo. to implement and share a C++ based library collection for 8bit AVR microcontroller (ATMEG328P), like in this STM32 tutorial:

I have written lot's of code during the years in C with Microchip Studio(Atmel Studio) IDE but I was always curious, 
can I implement the same library structure in C++, and can I simply write lines like Button1.read()... I hope so.
I'm familier with other OOP languges and OOP principle but not with C++, so implementing and sharing this is also a self learning activities.

New examples are uploaded! 

How to use GPIO and UART libraries and ISR template to store GPIO and UART callback routines addresses:

SPI class is uploded, find here an example how to use the SPI class for MCP3201 ADC device:
