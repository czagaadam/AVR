Welcome to the AVR wiki!

The purpose of this repo. to implement and share the same structure of libraries with 8bit AVR microcontroller (ATMEG328P), like in this tutorial:

I have lot's of code written in C in Microchip Studio(Atmel Studio) IDE but I was always curious, can I implement the same libraries in C++, and simple write that Button1.read()... I hope so.
I was familier with other OOP languges and OOP principle but not with C++, so implementing and sharing this is also a self learning activities.
