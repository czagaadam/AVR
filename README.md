I have written lot's of code during the years in C with Microchip Studio(Atmel Studio) IDE but I was always curious, 
can I implement the same library structure in C++, and can I simply write lines like Button1.read()... I hope so.
I'm familier with other OOP languges and OOP principle but not with C++, so implementing and sharing this is also a self learning activities.
